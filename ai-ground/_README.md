## --> ‚ùóÔ∏è fork this repo in order to participate in the hacking fest.

Welcome to the Ruby + AI Hacking Fest! This online hackathon is a weekend-long event starting on Friday night, May 17th, and concluding on Sunday afternoon, May 19th. The goal is to create a boilerplate Rails application using any existing, publicly available AI model. Participants will integrate the model into their Rails application via API, ensuring it runs seamlessly on a local machine.

# Rules and Guidelines
### Setup
* The application must run on a local machine (Mac or Linux).
* Integrate any existing and publicly available AI model with a Rails application.
* Docker is preferable but not mandatory.

### Development Rules
* You are allowed to use Hugging Face and their open-source libraries.
* All work must be original and created during the hackathon.
* Usage of pre-built integrations for Ruby and Rails, like Ollama, is prohibited.

### Submission Requirements
* A public repository on GitHub containing the application source code.
* The AI model and integration details.
* Clear instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.

# Judging Criteria
### Functionality:
* How well does the application run?
* Does it integrate the AI model effectively?

### Innovation:
* How unique and creative is the solution?
* Technical Difficulty:
* What challenges did you overcome?
* What was utilised from your previous experience?

### Documentation:
* Are the setup instructions clear and easy to follow?
* Was it clear to follow and get it the app up and running?

### Presentation:
* How well is it presented at the demo session?
* How interesting the idea and its applicability?

# Prizes
* Grand Prize: $500 for the best overall project.
