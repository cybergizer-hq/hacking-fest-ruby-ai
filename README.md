# ü§ñ Ruby + AI Hacking Fest ü§ñ
## --> ‚ùóÔ∏è fork this repo in order to participate in the hacking fest.

Welcome to the Ruby + AI Hacking Fest! This online hackathon is a weekend-long event starting on Friday night, May 17th, and concluding on Sunday afternoon, May 19th. The goal is to create a boilerplate Rails application using any existing, publicly available AI model. Participants will integrate the model into their Rails application via API, ensuring it runs seamlessly on a local machine.

# Rules and Guidelines
### Setup
It is sentiment analysis of the message. Comments belonging to the post can be **NEGATIVE**, **NEUTRAL** and **POSITIVE**. It is a microservice architecture, Flask, pytorch, transformers are used for AI part (labelling) and Rails is for web. This app can be used to find out what opinions people have about the news or something new. This app can be very helpful in areas such as legislation, commersing, business.

**AI**
transformers library is used from HuggingFace, pipeline analyzes loaded text

### Python
1. Create a new virtual environment:
```python
python3 -m venv venv
```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
```python
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install Flask and transformers dependencies:
```python
pip install flask transformers
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```


### Ruby on Rails Setup

1. Database setup:
```ruby
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
rails db:seed
```

### Running the application
1. Start the Flask server:
```python
python3 save_model.py
python3 app.py
```
2. Start the Ruby on Rails server:
```ruby
rails s
```
